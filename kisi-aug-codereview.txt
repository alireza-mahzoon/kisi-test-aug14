1)It would be better to have styles in another CSS file.
2)It is not obvious about the selectors from what part of body they are coming from
3)h1 and p have the same id
4)There are both inline style and style in the head
5)There are lots of div in the code it would be better to use article, section, footer, etc instead of that
